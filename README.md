# Recipe-book
A simple and clean recipe management app built with React, TypeScript, Zustand, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to add, edit, and delete recipes with a user-friendly interface. This project is great for learning basic CRUD operations, state management using Zustand, and component-based UI development in React.
